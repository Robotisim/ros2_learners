# Repository for ROS2 Future Developers

This collection accompanies the video tutorials on [RobotisIm](https://robotisim.com/) and the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-QzGbqufzwncwPQlOJfUXw).  Clone the repository into the `src` folder of your ROS 2 workspace and build the packages with `colcon`.

## Directory Overview

- [Libraries_for_robotics](Libraries_for_robotics/README.md) – small programs that verify and integrate common robotics libraries such as OMPL, PCL, OpenCV and PyTorch.
- [ai_assitance](ai_assitance/README.md) – Python nodes for circular motion, obstacle avoidance and a Gazebo bringup.
- [nodes](nodes/README.md) – C++ examples of publishers, subscribers, laser scans and launch files.
- [resources](resources/README.md) – quick reference command snippets.
- [transforms](transforms/README.md) – `tf2` tutorials with RViz and Gazebo visualisation.
- [navigation_tb3](navigation_tb3/README.md) – TurtleBot3 navigation demos using Nav2.
- [point_cloud_perception](point_cloud_perception/README.md) – PCL based point‑cloud processing and RTAB‑Map launches.
- [robot_math](robot_math/README.md) – turtlesim exercises demonstrating angular velocity and go‑to‑goal control.
- [turtlebot3_gazebo](turtlebot3_gazebo/README.md) – simulation assets and launch files for TurtleBot3 in Gazebo.

Each directory contains its own README with instructions on how to run the examples and what concepts they teach.
