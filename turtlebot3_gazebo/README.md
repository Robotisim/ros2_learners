# TurtleBot3 Gazebo

Gazebo simulation assets for the TurtleBot3 robot.

## Running the Simulation
Launch the default world with a single TurtleBot3:
```bash
ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch.py
```
Other launch files in the `launch/` directory provide additional worlds such as `turtlebot3_house.launch.py` or allow spawning into an existing Gazebo instance.

## Resources
Documentation and tutorials for TurtleBot3 are available from [ROBOTIS](http://turtlebot3.robotis.com/) and the [turtlebot3_simulations](https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_simulations) repository, on which this package is based.

What you'll learn: running the TurtleBot3 robot in Gazebo for experimentation and testing.
